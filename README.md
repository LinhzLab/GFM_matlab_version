# GFM
Generalized factor model for ultra-high dimensional variables with mixed types --MATLAB version

Please see our new paper for model details:

## Advantage of computation
We develop a two-step iterative procedure so that each update can be carried out in  parallel across all variables and samples. The fast computation version is provided for ultra-high data, see gfm_example.m file.

## R version of GFM

We also develop the corresponding R verion of GFM that is available [here](https://github.com/LinhzLab/GFM). However, we suggest users to use the MATLAB version since it is more computationally efficient than R version in handling large-scale high-dimensional data.
